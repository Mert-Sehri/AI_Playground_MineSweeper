These two python files were generated using the CoPilot tool associated with VsCode add on. 

Prompt 1: Can you code a basic mine sweeper game please.

Prompt 2: Can you make a gui version of the game so I can see it as a box please.

This shows even with poor prompting you are able to get a functioning code. Always make sure all your dependencies are in place :-)
